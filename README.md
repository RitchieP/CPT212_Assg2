# CPT 212 Assignment 2
### Algorithm
Our program was implemented with the NetworkX library. https://networkx.org/

## Instructions
To run our program, please make sure that the following dependencies are installed.
 - networkx
 - matplotlib
These two libraries are needed for all the functions within the project.
Our User Interface (UI) is implemented to be user friendly and it guides user
by prompting for the input step by step. You should see a default graph upon running the program. 
Once default graph's pop-out window is closed, you are able to select and utilize the functions on 
the menu displayed.
